### 🟢 Stage 1: Basics of BFS and DFS on Graphs

These will form your intuition for exploring graphs.

|     |                                      |                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| #   | Problem                              | Concept                   |
| 1   | 997. Find the Town Judge             | Basic graph traversal     |
| 2   | 200. Number of Islands               | DFS/BFS on 2D grid        |
| 3   | 1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph   | DFS/BFS in adjacency list |
| 4   | 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix | BFS on 2D grid            |

✅ Goal: Get comfortable with BFS, DFS, and grid traversal

### 🟡 Stage 2: Unweighted Graphs – Use BFS for Shortest Path

In unweighted graphs, the shortest path is the fewest number of steps. Use BFS here.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|#|Problem|Concept|
|5|752. Open the Lock|BFS with visited set|
|6|127. Word Ladder|BFS + string transformation|
|7|815. Bus Routes|Graph BFS with levels|
|8|279. Perfect Squares|BFS on numbers|

✅ Goal: Master BFS to find shortest path in unweighted problems (grids, strings, queues).**
### 🔵 Stage 3: Weighted Graphs – Dijkstra’s Algorithm

If weights are involved, use Dijkstra’s Algorithm (greedy + priority queue)

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|#|Problem|Concept|
|9|743. Network Delay Time|Basic Dijkstra|
|10|787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops|Dijkstra + stop count|
|11|1631. Path With Minimum Effort|Min-heap + Dijkstra on grid|
|12|1514. Path with Maximum Probability|Dijkstra with probabilities|

✅ Goal: Understand and implement Dijkstra using a priority queue

### 🔴 Stage 4: Advanced Algorithms (Optional)

If you master above, then try:
- Bellman-Ford (for negative weights)  
- Floyd-Warshall (all-pairs shortest path)  
- A* Algorithm (heuristic pathfinding)
