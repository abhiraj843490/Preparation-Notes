Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Java Developer position at the Drive Switch. With over two years of hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and API development.

In my recent role, I worked extensively on designing and developing scalable backend services using Java Spring Boot. I have strong experience in building REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, implementing microservice-based architectures, and integrating distributed systems. My exposure to Kafka, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Docker has helped me work efficiently on cloud-ready and containerized applications. I am also familiar with GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, and Agile development methodologies.

Apart from technical skills, I bring a strong problem-solving mindset, analytical thinking, and the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. I consistently focus on writing clean, maintainable code and ensuring high-quality deliverables through testing and documentation.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to  Drive Switch. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and experience align with the goals of your team.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.

Warm regards,
Abhiraj Kumar
