```java

Encapsulation in Java is a core object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that involves 
- bundling data (variables) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. It is a mechanism for restricting direct access to some of an object's components, protecting the internal state and promoting modularity.
