👉 Goal: Build strong object-oriented and modular design thinking.

**Topics:**

1. SOLID Principles — deep understanding with real-world Java examples
2. All **Creational Patterns** (Factory, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Builder, Prototype)
3. All **Structural Patterns** (Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Composite, Bridge)
4. All **Behavioral Patterns** (Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Template, Chain of Responsibility, etc.)

**System Design tie-in:**

- How patterns fit into large-scale systems (e.g., Observer in event-driven architecture, Factory in dependency creation).
